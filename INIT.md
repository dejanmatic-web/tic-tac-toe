You are working on a PvP XO game.

Rules:

-   Small incremental changes only
-   One iteration = one clear goal
-   Code must run after every iteration
-   Do not refactor unless explicitly told
-   Do not add dependencies without asking
-   Do not change architecture implicitly
-   If something is unclear, ask before coding
